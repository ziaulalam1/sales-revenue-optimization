## Executive Summary & Key Findings

Between 2015 and 2018, a national bike retailer experienced steady revenue growth, with notable disparities in regional performance, product profitability, and employee productivity. This analysis identifies core revenue drivers and areas for operational improvement, ultimately providing a roadmap for increased profitability.

---

### **1. Revenue Growth with AOV Volatility**
Total sales peaked at $800,000+ in late 2018, indicating strong momentum. However, average order value (AOV) showed considerable fluctuation, ranging from ~$1,000 to nearly $2,000.  
These inconsistencies suggest opportunities for promotional timing and pricing strategies to stabilize revenue throughout the year.

### **2. Small Subset of Products = Majority of Revenue**
Out of all SKUs sold, the top two products generated nearly $945,000, with one model — Trek Slash 8 27.5 - 2016 — contributing $555,558 alone.  
This trend (20% of products → 80%+ of revenue) signals a clear opportunity for inventory prioritization, upselling, and bundled marketing.

---

### **3. New York Dominates Regional Sales**
New York alone generated $5.2M, accounting for over 68% of total revenue — outperforming California and Texas combined.  
The company should double down on NY, while evaluating underperformance in other markets and testing targeted campaigns in CA and TX.

---

### **4. Significant Variance in Staff Order Fulfillment**
Top employees such as Marcelene Boyer (553 orders) and Venita Daniel (540 orders) handled 6x more orders than their peers, who processed as few as 86.  
This points to an opportunity to replicate successful employee behaviors, introduce mentoring, or implement incentive systems.

## Strategic Recommendations

### **Top Product Performance**

- **Double Down on Bestsellers**: Allocate more marketing spend and front-page space to high-performing products like the *Trek Slash 8 27.5 - 2016*, which alone generated $555,558. Prioritize them for bundle offers and holiday campaigns.
- **Refine Inventory Strategy**: Maintain consistent stock levels for top products contributing over $150K annually. Flag items with low sales and high holding costs for reassessment or discontinuation.
- **Explore Product Variations**: Introduce premium versions or color/feature variants of top sellers to cater to loyal customer segments and drive repeat purchases.

---

### **Increasing Average Order Value (AOV)**

- **Promote High-Value Bundles**: Create attractive bundles pairing top-selling bikes with accessories (e.g., helmets, tools, apparel) to increase cart size without increasing acquisition cost.
- **Time-Based Promotions**: Launch targeted promotions during historically low AOV months (e.g., Q1 or early Q3) to maintain profitability year round.
- **Minimum Threshold Incentives**: Offer perks (free shipping, discount, bonus gift) for orders over a target threshold (e.g., $1,800) to nudge customers toward higher AOV.

---

### **Regional Expansion & Marketing**

- **Invest Further in New York**: With NY driving over 68% of total sales, explore opportunities for expansion through new locations, local events, or influencer partnerships in this market.
- **Test Campaigns in CA and TX**: California and Texas underperformed significantly. Run A/B tested digital campaigns to identify messaging or product-market fit improvements in these states.
- **Geo-Targeted Promotions**: Launch region-specific offers that match seasonal buying behavior or local events to boost engagement in lagging markets.

---

### **Staff Productivity & Optimization**

- **Incentivize Top Performance**: Implement a recognition or bonus system modeled on top employees like Marcelene Boyer and Venita Daniel, who each processed 500+ orders.
- **Create Performance Playbooks**: Have high-performing employees document workflows or customer handling tips to help train lower-performing staff.

## Technical Workflow & Tools

This section outlines how the project was executed from raw data to final dashboard.

### Tools Used

| Tool           | Purpose                            |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| **SQL Server** | Data modeling and querying         |
| **Excel**      | Data cleaning and formatting       |
| **Tableau**    | Data visualization and dashboard   |
| **GitHub**     | Version control and documentation  |

---

### Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel)

- Replaced empty cells with `NULL`, removed duplicates, and standardized formats across all date, currency, and ID fields  
- Merged and cleaned `customers.csv`, `orders.csv`, and `staffs.csv` to ensure relational integrity  
- Recast inconsistent column types (e.g., numeric `manager_id` was string in some files)  

Cleaned data available in the `/Cleaned Data` folder  
Raw files remain in `/Data`

---

### SQL Data Modeling & Analysis

- Imported 9 CSVs into SQL Server  
- Defined primary and foreign keys for accurate joins  
- Wrote 8 queries using `INNER`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT JOINs` to extract:
  - Total and monthly revenue
  - Orders by staff and region
  - Product performance  
- Exported final query results to CSV for use in Tableau

All SQL scripts are located in `/SQL`

### Challenges & Solutions

- **Data Type Inconsistencies**  
  Solved by manually building SQL tables with proper types and using `BULK INSERT` to load.

- **Unfocused Start**  
  Refocused around solving real business problems, which guided query design and dashboard layout.

- **Low-Variance Fields**  
  Chose to get rid of irrelevant or flat data columns to ensure clean, meaningful visuals.
